<h3 align="center">A Minimal Z-Machine Implementation</h3>

This project my attempt to figure out how to create an emulator and interpreter implementation of the [Z-Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine). This was a virtual machine created by [Infocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom) to run their text adventures and was later adopted by a hobbyist community that continued the tradition.

My core implementation of the Z-Machine called [Quendor](https://github.com/jeffnyman/quendor) and is still a work in progress. In working on that project &mdash; and a practice implementation that I called [Entharion](https://github.com/jeffnyman/entharion) &mdash;it became clear to me that there might be benefit to using this work in a more pedagogical way. To that end, my ["zmachine" blog series](https://testerstories.com/category/zmachine/) will be an attempt to show how to build a Z-Machine emulator and interpreter.

You can read up more on the concept of a [grue](https://zork.fandom.com/wiki/Grue) should you find yourself curious.
